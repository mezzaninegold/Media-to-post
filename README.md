This is a wordpress plugin.

# Media to Post Plugin

Allows bulk uploading of images from the media uploader to be turned into posts / custom posts with featured images.

New posts are created using the file name of the image as the post title.



## Options

The options page allows you to switch between post types and select categories to be assigned.

## Issues

Currently the plugin needs to be deactivated when not bulk uploading as all images uploaded through wordpress will create new posts.

Contributions welcome.

## Roadmap

* Custom media uploader on the options panel so that only images uploaded there are added as posts.
* Scan for custom taxonmies and add them to options panel
* Option for Published/Draft etc
* Option for Tags
