This is a wordpress plugin.

# Media to Post Plugin

This plugin allows you to bulk create posts / custom posts from images uploaded to the wordpress media uploader.

New posts are created using the file name of the image as the post title and setting the image as the featured image.



## Options

The options page allows you to switch between post types and select categories to be assigned.

## Issues

Currently the plugin needs to be deactivated when not bulk uploading as all images uploaded through wordpress will create new posts.

Contributions welcome.

## Roadmap

* Custom media uploader on the options panel so that only images uploaded there are added as posts.
* Scan for custom taxonmies and add them to options panel
* Option for Published/Draft etc
* Option for Tags
