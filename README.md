This is a wordpress plugin.
=============
# Media to Post Plugin


This plugin allows you to create post / custom posts from images uploaded to the wordpress media uploader.

New posts are created using the file name of the image for the title and setting the image uploaded as the featured image.

## Options

The options page allows you to switch between post types and select categories to be assigned.

## Issues

Currently the plugin needs to be deactivated when not bulk uploading as all images uploaded through wordpress will create new posts.
